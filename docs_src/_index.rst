Installation
============

You can install Tokult from the github repository using ``pip``:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/sugayu/tokult.git@dev

Before using this command, it may be good to create a new Python
environment for Tokult.

To update the package, you may need to add the ``--upgrade`` option.

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/sugayu/tokult.git@dev

.. note::

   This command installs the program code from the branch "dev" (=
   development). We will remove ``@dev`` when the code is open to
   public.
