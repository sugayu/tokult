You can install Tokult from the github repository using ~pip~:
#+begin_src bash
  $ pip install git+https://github.com/sugayu/tokult.git@dev
#+end_src
Before using this command, it may be good to create a new Python environment for Tokult.

To update the package, you may need to add the ~--upgrade~ option.
#+begin_src bash
  $ pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/sugayu/tokult.git@dev
#+end_src
